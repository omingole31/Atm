This project is a simple ATM Machine simulation implemented in Java, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles. It provides basic ATM functionalities, including viewing the available balance, withdrawing money in multiples of 500, depositing money, and viewing a mini statement of recent transactions. 
The AtmOperationInterface defines the methods for ATM operations. The Atm class represents the ATM with attributes for balance, deposit, and withdrawal amounts. The AtmImplementations class implements the defined operations, handling transactions and maintaining a record of deposits and withdrawals. The AtmMain class serves as the entry point, managing user authentication through an ATM number and PIN, and providing a menu-driven interface for transactions.
Users can interact with the ATM by entering their credentials. Upon successful authentication, they can perform various operations such as checking their balance, withdrawing or depositing money, and viewing a mini statement. The program ensures that withdrawals are only allowed in specified denominations and prevents transactions that exceed the available balance. This simulation provides a basic representation of how an ATM system operates.
